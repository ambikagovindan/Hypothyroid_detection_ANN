# Hypothyroid Disease Detection using Deep Learning

Hypothyroidism, also called underactive thyroid, is when the thyroid gland doesn’t make enough thyroid hormones to meet your body’s needs. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. Thyroid hormones control the way your body uses energy, so they affect nearly every organ in your body, even the way your heart beats. Without enough thyroid hormones, many of your body’s functions slow down.

Additional Information providede in the above link

* From Garavan Institute
* Documentation: as given by Ross Quinlan
* 6 databases from the Garavan Institute in Sydney, Australia
* Approximately the following for each database:

    ** 2800 training (data) instances and 972 test instances
    ** Plenty of missing data
    ** 29 or so attributes, either Boolean or continuously-valued 

* 2 additional databases, also from Ross Quinlan, are also here

    ** Hypothyroid.data and sick-euthyroid.data
    ** Quinlan believes that these databases have been corrupted
    ** Their format is highly similar to the other databases 

* 1 more database of 9172 instances that cover 20 classes, and a related domain theory
* Another thyroid database from Stefan Aeberhard

    ** 3 classes, 215 instances, 5 attributes
    ** No missing values 

* A Thyroid database suited for training ANNs

    ** 3 classes
    ** 3772 training instances, 3428 testing instances
    ** Includes cost data (donated by Peter Turney)
